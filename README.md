# FlipFlopPK: Learn and Visualize Flip-Flop Pharmacokinetics

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/FlipFlopPK](https://shinyappstore.com/a/FlipFlopPK)__

FlipFlopPK is an interactive application designed to elucidate the concept of flip-flop kinetics within the realm of pharmacokinetics. In pharmacokinetics, flip-flop kinetics refer to scenarios where the absorption rate of a drug is significantly different from its elimination rate, leading to distinctive concentration-time profiles. For instance, consider a drug with rapid absorption but slow elimination, creating a flip-flop pattern in the concentration-time curve. FlipFlopPK facilitates a user-friendly experience, leveraging the capabilities of the shiny package in R. With an intuitive interface, users can dynamically observe the impact of adjusting absorption and elimination constants on the pharmacokinetic profile. This application serves as an educational tool, allowing individuals to explore and comprehend the intricate dynamics of drug pharmacokinetics through interactive visualizations.
